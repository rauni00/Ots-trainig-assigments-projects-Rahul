// Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
// Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.
// Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.
// You are given a large integer represented as an integer array digits, where each digits[i] is the ith digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading 0's. Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.
